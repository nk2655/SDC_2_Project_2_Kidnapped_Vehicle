# SDC_2_Project_2_Kidnapped_Vehicle
* This project will start on March 2nd based on C++ and Particle Filter.  
This module is also built with our partners at Mercedes-Benz, who employ cutting-edge localization techniques in their own autonomous vehicles. Implement and use foundational algorithms that every localization engineer needs to know.
